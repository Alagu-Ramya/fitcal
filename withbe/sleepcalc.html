<font color="lightgrey"><h4><b><u>*FOR the HEALTHY SLEEPERS OUT THERE!!</u><br><p> If ur sleep time exceeds or remains 8 hours everynight! CONGRADULATIONS! you a leading a healthy life!</p><br>
<u>*FOR the STINGY SLEEPERS OUT THERE!</u><br><p>It's easy to lay in the bed and toss and turn as we fight to let go of the day. But actually letting the day go is the only way to
 end a long day.
Even though the day was stressful, we did the best we could – and we deserve to rest.</p><br><u>*FOR DAYTIME NAPPERS OUT THERE!</u><br><p>Actually, naps are good for most people,
 a nap defined as daytime sleeping that lasts between 15 and 90 minutes can improve brain functions ranging from memory to focus and creativity. “For some people, 
naps are as restorative as a whole night of sleep”.
More research shows a quick nap can lower stress and recharge your willpower. And napping has also been linked to lower rates of 
 cardiovascular disease and inflammation.</p><br><u>*FOR the NIGHTIME OWLS OUT THERE!</u><p>You love to say you're a night owl, yet your body is telling 
a very different story.Sleeping late makes you wake up late and this can lead to loss of concentration. Sleeping beyond nature’s permissible sleep hours can offset your mood
 and lead to considerable drop in concentration. It’s always advisable to lead life according to the in-built
 time table of the body. Moreover, if your counterparts are waking in time, it means you can lag behind them in the day’s work and reduced time means a lack of 
 concentration too.</p><br><u>*FOR the INSOMANIACS OUT THERE!!</u><br><p>Insomnia is difficult in its own right, but it may also cause other issues, both psychological and physical.
 Many people with insomnia feel more refreshed when they get proper treatment and finally begin to sleep well again.
Chronic insomnia (difficulty sleeping for three months or longer) may also lead to changes in mood, lack of motivation and energy, irritability, and more.
When you're drowsy, it may make you feel tense and preoccupied, and the worry over your inability to sleep can add to this.</p><br><u>TIME TO GETOVER YOUR SLEEP DISORDERS!</u><br><p>
To help stay asleep through the night, try some of these strategies to relieve insomnia:

Establish a quiet, relaxing bedtime routine. For example, drink a cup of caffeine-free tea, take a warm shower or listen to soft music. Avoid prolonged use of electronic
 devices with a screen, such as laptops, smartphones and ebooks before bed.
Relax your body. Gentle yoga or progressive muscle relaxation can ease tension and help tight muscles to relax.
Make your bedroom conducive to sleep. Keep light, noise and the temperature at levels that are comfortable and won't disturb your rest. Don't engage in activities other 
than sleeping or sex in your bedroom. This will help your body know this room is for sleeping.
Put clocks in your bedroom out of sight. Clock-watching causes stress and makes it harder to go back to sleep if you wake up during the night.</p> <b></h4>
